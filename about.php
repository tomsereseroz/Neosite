<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Hello! My name is Thomas J. Sereseroz. Although my family calls me TJ, since my father and grandfather are also named Thomas.
I'm a 26 year old Michigan native. My parents are children of immigrants, my mothers side coming from Bolivia, and my father's from Mexico.
I've always had a fascination with robots and space. When my mom helped me make an email account at the age of 10, I asked for it to be named robo_tj.
If I could choose a new first name, it would be James, like James kirk, James Hawkins, and James Isaac Neutron. My steam profile/Twitch name is Mint Robot.
</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
I've lived in lansing for most of my life, graduating from Grand Ledge High School in 2014. 
My mom taught me how to read at 3 or 4 years old, and she did a good enough job to have me testing at a third grade reading level on day one of kindergarden. 
I read a lot of books back in elementary school. As time passed and youtube became prevalent I read less and watched more. Nowadays I barely manage to read one book a year, although If I find a good read I can get through a book in a couple hours.
While at Grand Ledge I had the privelage of taking AP classes in calculus, physics, chemistry, and writing.
I was also able to dual-enroll in Lansing community college my senior year to take calculus 3 and calc-based physics. 
I entered freshman year of college at Michigan State University with 33 credits, and completed my Electrical Enginering major/Computer Science minor degree in 3 years.
</p>
<h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>
I've had an affinity for swimming for longer than I can remember. I like the calmness of being submerged, when all the noise in the atmosphere fades away.
I learned to swim in preschool, but didn't join a competitive swim team until I split my collar bone in 7th grade and was unable to play contact sports for a few months. 
I joined the Delphinus swim club my freshamn year of high school, and by junior year I was setting records and winning events in the capital area athletic conference. 
After 8 years I still have the 200 and 500 freestyle records. I also played water polo throughout high school and college. 
We swimmers would joke that the only other sport that had it as bad as us was wrestling, but obviously it takes a lot of effort to make it to the top of any sport.
</p>
<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>
I've also played video games for as long as I can remember! 
I have some distant memories of being 4 or 5 years old, playing various playstation one games with my dad. 
I also remember finding moves to spam in street fighter to actually win some matches against my dad at that age. 
I got a playstation 2 demo disk which had one or two levels from several different games, and was instantly addicted to Ratchet and Clank.
I played the first level from that demo maybe 20 times before my mom suggested we get the full game. I wasn't even aware there was more to it!
With both my parents at the critical point in their careers (dad just started a company (RS Engineering), mom helping out with the company and working her job as well) I stayed out of trouble most days by playing games. 
I started hanging out with friends from the neighborhood around first grade, and maybe half of our time was spent indoors playing conkers bad fur day on the N64. 
Elementary school was the age of mario party and kirby's air ride on the Gamecube, followed by call of duty in middle school and League of Legends, Minecraft, and Starcraft 2 in High school.
Video games had brought me so much excitement, fascination, and emotions that I wanted to make a career as a video game developer. Streamer is my actual dream job, as all they have to do is play (and be entertaining/comfortable on air).

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
I worked part time as a lifeguard and swim instructor in my last two years at Grand Ledge.
While enrolled at MSU I worked with the College of Engineering Recruitment and outreach center as a student ambassador, giving tours of the campus and helping set up events.
As a freshman and sophomore, I worked at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) as a technician, verifying P&ID diagrams and the resonant frequency of cavities.
I also augmented some Java code that a beam physicist used to take Q-value measurements of the cavities in production.
I left for Fraunhofer CCD my junior year and did a TON of CAD work converting real parts for a HPHT system into 3d-object files. 
Post-graduation I joined the Nondestructive Evaluation lab at MSU, but dropped out after two semesters as I didn't want to Lock-in NDE as my carreer.
I left the lab in february 2020 to join IBM as a verification engineer working in C++, but my at-will contract was terminated in two months from the fallout of the COVID pandemic.
</p>
<h2>2020, the "New normal"</h2>
<p>
As I'm sure we all were impacted by the events of 2020, my pace of life shifted drastically as well. I used the pandemic as an excuse to finally take a break from working for companies, and started working for myself. 
I started learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and took a month or so to make a video game that can run in the browser.
Programming has always been easy for me. Just like math, it makes sense in that the same equations give the same result every time. 
</p>
<h2>2021, exploration</h2>
<p>
2021 was a gap-year for me. My first break from working and stress in 9 years. I spent a lot of time traveling, visiting family and friends.
I also spent time thinking about what I really want my lifestyle to be like. How I want to spend my time, and what I'm willing to sacrifice for.
I feel like a gap year helped me unwind from all the pressure built up over the past decade, but who knows, maybe it'll come back If I reapply the pressure.
</p>
<h2>2022, Now</h2>
<p>
2022 is my year of new beginnings. I'd like to grow my presense as a streamer and my knowledge/clientelle as a programmer. 
Ironically, I don't really have any near-future career plans to use my electrical engineering degree.
I'm not looking for Electrical engineering jobs at the moment, but if a good opportunity arises I won't hesitate to take it!
