<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>My name is Thomas J. Sereseroz. My family calls me TJ, since technically I'm Thomas III, after my fathers. I'm a 27 year old Michigan native, now living in Georgia. I'm a second generation North-American. My parents were also born here. Before that, my mother's mother comes from bolivia and my father's father comes from mexico. My gaming aliases are Mint Robot, Mintus, or Robotommy.</p>
<h2>Interests:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>Space, Robotics, Physics and Video Games.</b></i> My favorite movie growing up was Treasure planet. My first email was called robo_tj.</li>

        To keep me occupied when I was around the house, my parents got me video games to play. I vaguely remember playing street fighter and some tank game on the playstation 1, however the first games I can name are from the 2001-2002 playstation 2/gamecube era, such as Pikmin, Paper Mario, Sonic Adventure, Sly Cooper, Ratchet & Clank, Pokemon, etc. etc.

        In middle school I found physics channels to watch on youtube, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sixtysymbols" target="_blank">sixty symbols</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium" target="_blank">veritasium</a>. Learning a new concept or trick with physics is always rewarding to me. I also saw Iron Man around that time, and I couldn't help but imagine a day when I could have a robotics lab of my own. That heavily influencd my decision to choose electrical engineering as a major in college.

        In high school I got access to a fancy TI-84 graphing calculator and found out how to program pong onto it. I then made a battleship game where one could pass the calculator in-between turns. This opened my eyes to the programming side of video games, of which I've been enamored with ever since. My mom got me signed up for a week-long video game dev bootcamp one summer, where I had a ton of fun learning how to make maps for unreal tournament III in the unreal editor.

<h2>Career Goals:</h2>
<p>My realistic career goals are to be a member of a game development or robotics team, working on things that change the world for the better. My ideal careers would be to own a R&D lab of my own, work in a small video game startup with a close team, or stream games/projects for content. For retirement in my later years, I want to have a quaint little farm to work on, so I can source honey, fruits, vegetables, eggs and maybe even dairy from my own backyard.</p>
<h2>Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming/Logistics - My history with video games has led me to become quite adept at analyzing logic in programming and systems. I like the challenge that comes with not only programming something successfully, but refining the algorithm to be as efficient as possible. </li>
<li>Electrical Engineering - I have a bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Kirchhoff's circuit laws, Ohm's Law, and Maxwell's equations are the foundation of my understanding of electromagnetics. The cool thing about Ohm's law is that it can be applied to temperature or pressure systems to analyze those as well.</li>
